## Full Stack Web Development by MERN

Full Stack Web Development refers to the development of both the front-end and back-end components of a web application. The MERN stack is a popular choice for full stack web development, which consists of the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js that provides a set of features for building web applications and APIs.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side.

By learning the MERN stack, you will be able to develop end-to-end web applications, from the database to the user interface. This comprehensive approach to web development enables you to handle both the front-end and back-end aspects of a project, making you a versatile and in-demand developer.

To learn Full Stack Web Development with the MERN stack, you can follow these steps:

### Front-end Development

Start by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the core technologies for front-end development. Gain a solid understanding of web design fundamentals and how to create interactive and responsive user interfaces.

### Back-end Development

Once you have a good grasp of front-end development, dive into server-side programming with Node.js and Express.js. Learn how to build APIs, handle data storage and retrieval with MongoDB, and implement server-side logic.

### Integration

Combine your front-end and back-end skills to create full stack web applications. Use React to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces that communicate with your server-side APIs.

### Deployment

Learn how to deploy your web applications to hosting platforms like Heroku or AWS. Understand the process of setting up a production environment and managing your application in a live server environment.

## Before Start let's know about Internet Basics

### Browser

A web browser is a software application used to access information on the World Wide Web. When a user requests a web page by entering a URL or clicking a link, the browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and renders it on the user's device.

**How Browsers Work:**

- **User Interface (UI):** This includes the address bar, back/forward buttons, bookmarking menu, etc.
- **Browser Engine:** Manages actions between the UI and the rendering engine.
- **Rendering Engine:** Interprets HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the web page.
- **Networking:** Handles network calls, such as HTTP requests.
- **JavaScript Interpreter:** Executes JavaScript code.
- **UI Backend:** Draws basic widgets like combo boxes and windows.
- **Data Storage:** Stores data like cookies and web storage.

Popular browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Opera.

### HTTP, HTTPS

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):**

- An application protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.
- HTTP follows a client-server model where the browser (client) makes requests and the server responds.
- It operates over TCP/IP and is stateless, meaning each request is executed independently without any knowledge of previous requests.

**HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):**

- An extension of HTTP that uses encryption (via SSL/TLS) to secure data transfer.
- It ensures data integrity and privacy between the client and server.
- Websites with HTTPS show a padlock icon in the browser's address bar.

### Domain

A domain name is a human-readable address used to access websites. It maps to an IP address, which is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network.

**How Domains Work:**

- **Domain Name System (DNS):** Translates domain names into IP addresses.
- **Top-Level Domains (TLDs):** Include .com, .org, .net, etc.
- **Second-Level Domains:** Typically the name of the website (e.g., `example` in `example.com`).
- **Subdomains:** Prefixes to the second-level domain (e.g., `blog.example.com`).

Domains are essential for navigation on the internet, allowing users to access websites without remembering IP addresses.

### Hosting

Web hosting is a service that allows individuals and organizations to make their websites accessible via the World Wide Web.

**Types of Hosting:**

- **Shared Hosting:** Multiple websites share the same server resources.
- **VPS Hosting (Virtual Private Server):** A virtualized server providing dedicated resources.
- **Dedicated Hosting:** A single server dedicated to one website.
- **Cloud Hosting:** Resources are spread across multiple servers, providing scalability.
- **Managed Hosting:** The hosting provider manages the server and infrastructure.

**Process:**

1. **Choose a hosting provider.**
2. **Register a domain name.**
3. **Upload website files.**
4. **Configure DNS settings to point to the hosting server.**

### How Websites Work

#### Client-Server Model

The client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks between clients (requesters) and servers (providers).

- **Client:** A user device running a web browser.
- **Server:** A machine hosting the website, serving client requests.
- **Communication:** Clients send HTTP/HTTPS requests; servers process them and send back responses.

#### HTTP Request and Response

**HTTP Request:**

- **Methods:** Defines the type of action (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Headers:** Contains metadata (e.g., User-Agent, Accept-Language).
- **Body:** Contains data (for methods like POST).

**HTTP Response:**

- **Status Code:** Indicates the result of the request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
- **Headers:** Contains metadata (e.g., Content-Type, Set-Cookie).
- **Body:** Contains the content (HTML, JSON, etc.).

### Web Design Fundamentals - HTML, CSS, JS

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):**

- The standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **Elements:** Structure content (e.g., `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<div>`, `<a>`).
- **Attributes:** Provide additional information (e.g., `href`, `src`, `class`).

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):**

- Describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
- **Selectors:** Target HTML elements (e.g., `#id`, `.class`, `element`).
- **Properties:** Define styles (e.g., `color`, `font-size`, `margin`).

**JavaScript:**

- A programming language that enables interactivity on web pages.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Allows dynamic changes to HTML and CSS.
- **Events:** Handles user actions (e.g., clicks, key presses).
- **APIs:** Interacts with external services (e.g., fetch data).

Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the foundation of web development, enabling the creation of structured, styled, and interactive web pages.
