**Basic HTML Document Structure:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Typography

**Typography** in HTML refers to the styling and arrangement of text on a webpage.

**Basic Typography Elements:**

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>

### HTML5/Semantic HTML

**HTML5** introduced several new semantic elements that help improve the structure and readability of the HTML code. These elements provide meaning to the content they wrap, making it easier for browsers, search engines, and developers to understand the hierarchy and type of content.

**Key Semantic Elements in HTML5:**

- **`<header>`**: Represents introductory content or a set of navigational links.
- **`<nav>`**: Contains the navigation links for the website.
- **`<main>`**: Represents the main content of the document, excluding headers, footers, and sidebars.
- **`<section>`**: Defines a section in a document, typically with a heading.
- **`<article>`**: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed independently.
- **`<aside>`**: Contains content that is tangentially related to the content around it, often used for sidebars.
- **`<footer>`**: Represents the footer of a document or a section, usually containing metadata or links to related documents.

**Example of Semantic HTML:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Semantic HTML Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>My Website</h1>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
          <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
      <section id="home">
        <h2>Welcome to My Website</h2>
        <p>This is the home section.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>This is the about section.</p>
      </section>
      <article>
        <h2>Latest Article</h2>
        <p>This is a self-contained article.</p>
      </article>
    </main>
    <aside>
      <h2>Related Links</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Link 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Link 2</a></li>
      </ul>
    </aside>

### Fundamentals of CSS

#### Introduction to CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages, allowing you to apply styles to elements, control the layout, and enhance the appearance of your website.

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Introduction to CSS</title>
    <style>
      body {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        background-color: #f4f4f4;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, CSS!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### CSS Selectors & Combinators

CSS selectors are patterns used to select the elements you want to style. Combinators define the relationship between the selectors.

**Example:**

```css
/* Selects all <p> elements */
p {
  color: blue;
}

/* Selects <p> elements inside <div> */
div p {
  color: red;
}

/* Selects all <p> elements with class 'intro' */
p.intro {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* Selects the first <p> element */
p:first-of-type {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

#### CSS Typography

CSS allows you to control text styles such as font, size, weight, and spacing.

**Example:**

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 2em;
  font-family: "Georgia", serif;
  color: #333;
}

p {
  font-size: 1em;
  line-height: 1.5;
  color: #666;
}
```

#### CSS Box Model

The CSS Box Model represents the structure of a web page's elements, including margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

**Example:**

```css
div {
  width: 300px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 5px solid red;
  margin: 15px;
}
```

### Advanced CSS

#### Shadow & Gradients

Add depth and dimension to elements using shadows and gradients.

**Example:**

```css
/* Box shadow */
box {
  box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;
}

/* Linear gradient */
div {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, red, yellow);
}
```

#### Transitions & Animation

CSS transitions and animations add dynamic behavior to elements.

**Example:**

```css
/* Transition */
button {
  transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: blue;
}

/* Animation */
@keyframes example {
  from {
    background-color: red;
  }
  to {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
}

div {
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
}
```

#### Variables

CSS variables (custom properties) store values that can be reused throughout the stylesheet.

**Example:**

```css
:root {
  --main-color: #3498db;
  --padding: 10px;
}

button {
  color: var(--main-color);
  padding: var(--padding);
}
```

#### Responsiveness

Make web pages adapt to different screen sizes using media queries and responsive units.

**Example:**

```css
/* Media query */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
```

### CSS Layout

#### Position, Floats, Flexbox, Grid

CSS provides various techniques for layout, including position, floats, Flexbox, and Grid.

**Example (Flexbox):**

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
}
```

**Example (Grid):**

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 10px;
}

.item {
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
}
```

### CSS Architecture

#### BEM/SMACSS

CSS architecture methodologies like BEM (Block Element Modifier) and SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS) help maintain scalable and organized code.

**Example (BEM):**

```html
<div class="block">
  <div class="block__element block__element--modifier"></div>
</div>
```

### CSS Frameworks & Pre-processors

#### Bootstrap 5 / Tailwind CSS

Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS are popular frameworks that provide pre-built styles and components to streamline development.

**Example (Bootstrap):**

```html
<link
  href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">Column 1</div>
    <div class="col-md-4">Column 2</div>
    <div class="col-md-4">Column 3</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### SASS / LESS / PostCSS

Pre-processors like SASS and LESS extend CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.

**Example (SASS):**

```scss
$main-color: #3498db;
.container {
  color: $main-color;
  padding: 20px;
  .item {
    background-color: lighten($main-color, 10%);
  }
}
```
